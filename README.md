CS344-Project1
==============

This project is for Semmy Purewal's CS344 class.
The objective is to build two websites using twitter bootstrap and zurb foundation.

Inspirations:

Gorgeous layout. Took inspiration from dark background and 1/3 content setup (1 large row then a row with 3 smaller)

Beautiful nav bar. Took inspiration from dark nav bar, alignment of links.

Was also very interested with the sticky nav bar. Played around with it a bit.

Enjoyed playing with carousel/orbit.
